Short tuto to deploy an ERC-721 contract, mint an NFT and publish it on Opensea on Rinkeby testnet


## 1) Install Metamask
Go to https://metamask.io/download/ and install the Metamask plugin for your web browser.

## 2) Create a wallet
Open the Metamask plugin and follow the steps to create a wallet. Don't forget to write down your recovery phrase. It will allow you to recover access to your funds if you lose access to your computer for any reason.

## 3) Get ethers from the faucet
Go to https://rinkebyfaucet.com/ and paste your address from your Metamask account. The transfer can take time depending on the congestion on the faucet.
While waiting for your ethers, you can continue with the next steps.

## 4) Open Remix IDE
Go to https://remix.ethereum.org/.
Choose "LOAD FROM: Gist" and paste this ID `6c6e9e24da34d014215a6632bc077f04`. It will open a DemoERC721.sol file. This is a simple implementation of the ERC721 standard with an auto-incrementing minting function. It is based on OpenZeppelin reference implementation.
